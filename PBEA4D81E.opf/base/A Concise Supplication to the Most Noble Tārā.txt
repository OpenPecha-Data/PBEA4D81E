A Concise Supplication to the Most Noble Tārā
by Chöying Tobden Dorje

om, jetsün drolma tukjé chen
Oṃ. Noble Tārā, most compassionate and kind,
kudok karmo ö tro ma
Your beautiful and radiant white form
rab dzé dangden yi ong ma
Has captured my mind. I pray to you:
dak ni né dön dra gyö dang
Protect me from the fears of sickness, spirit harm, enemies, disputes,
khorwa ngensong bardo sok
As well as those arising in the bardo;
jikpa kün lé kyab tu sol
Of saṃsāra in general and the three lower realms in particular.
tsering lü sem dewa dang
Grant me longevity, physical and mental comfort and contentment,
sampé dön kün drubpa dang
The fulfilment of all my wishes,
zé gö longchö gyé gyur té
Along with an increase of food, clothing, and enjoyments.
taktu chö la chöpar shok
May I always act in accordance with the Dharma and,
gyalyum drolmé shyal tong né
Having beheld your face, Tārā, mother of all Buddhas,
gyalwé sé su dak gyur chik
May I become a child of the victorious,
gyalwé gongpa tok gyur té
Realize the enlightened intent,
gyalwa nam dang kal nyam shok
And ultimately awaken—equal in fortune to all Buddhas.
